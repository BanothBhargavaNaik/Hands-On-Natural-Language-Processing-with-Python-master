Sentiment Analysis using TF-IDF model and Linear SVC

Data: 
50000 movie reviews from IMDB has been used in this model,
out of which 40000 reviews have been used to train and rest of the
10000 reviews have been used to test the model performance.

Preprocessing:
Preprocessing stage consists of removing non-character symbols, 
adding 'not_' before the word where there's an occurence of 'not' etc.
The preprocessed data is stored in corpus.

Model:
Here I have used TfidfVectorizer from sklearn.feature_extraction.text
library which works similarly to CounterVectorizer followed by
TfidfTransformer. Due to this we can assign different weights to words,
and all words are not given the same importance.

Machine Learning:
There are 2000 features used in this model and because of that
LinearSVC works the best for predicting sentiments with a accuracy of
89.80%. This model is also tested with other learning algorithms like
MultinomialNB, RandomForest with 500 estimators and LinearSVC out-performs
all of them.

Cross Validation:
We have used 10 fold cross validation on this model to determine the
accuracy of the model on different datasets and we get a mean of 89.80%
from all the 10 results.

Complete list of Accuracies per max_feature value:
1000 86.50%
2000 88.27%
3000 88.87%
4000 89.17%
5000 89.28%
6000 89.42%
7000 89.61%
8000 89.62%
9000 89.74%
10000 89.74%
12000 89.80%
